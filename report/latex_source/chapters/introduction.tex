gMark \cite{Bagan2016GMark:Queries} is a domain- and query language-independent framework targeting highly tunable generation of both graph instances and graph query workloads based on user-defined schemas \cite{BaganG.andBonifatiA.andCiucanuR.andFletcherG.H.L.andLemayA.andAdvokaat2016GMarkProject}. As such, gMark can be used to generate synthetic graph instances to be used in experiments where graph datasets are needed but for various reasons not easily acquired. This study will first examine gMark's data model, then possible extensions to gMark's data model and will then examine the state of the art in the area of synthetic graph generation in order to identify possible improvements to gMark's graph generation capabilities.
