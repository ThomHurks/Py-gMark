This poses some interesting challenges. It may seem tempting to randomly generate the attribute values, but if the resulting synthetic graph is expected to be representative of real-world graphs clearly this will generate invalid or conflicting information. If a person is still alive, then the person's birth date needs to be plausible given the average lifespan of humans and names should not be random sequences of characters and be consistent with gender.
In other words, since property values are correlated in real-world graphs, they should be correlated in the synthetic graphs too. Besides correlations between property values for a given node, the property values also need to be sensible within the whole network. For example, if nodes of type Person have a property \textit{income}, then the distribution of all \textit{income} values over all nodes of type Person should match typical real-world income distributions.
